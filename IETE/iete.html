    <h2> Objective</h2>
    <p class="text-justify1">The International conference on Nano-Bio technology is organized by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology (Formerly known as West Bengal University of Technolgy) in October, 2016 in Kolkata, India. The sequel of this conference will be held in tentatively 20th -21st January, 2024 in Kolkata, India, jointly organized by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology and The Institution of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers (IETE), Delhi, India. The main focus of this multi-disciplinary conference on the state-of-art collaborations between nanotechnology and bioscience, and their substantial technological characteristics. The attendees will gain cutting edge acquaintance of nano-supported technological developments for emerging nano-medicine, nano-biosensors, point of care devices, nano and bio devices involving to health care and other relevant issues. The main aspect of this conference is to create an open platform where the leading scientists, researchers, engineers, and scholar students can exchange, discuss and share their experiences, innovative ideas, and research results all about of electrical, electronic and biological device technology and modelling in the field of nano bio science. This forum is also open to discuss the real world challenges encountered and the solutions adopted. This conference will also deliver an opening to native, provincial and international industries-service providers to present their technologies, products and services. Moreover, we want to continue our conference in the succeeding years also, to shape a community against the conference. 
        This conference mainly focus on the presentation and discussion of recent advancements in the field of nano science and bio technology. The growing level of integration for nano scale device designing in bio-molecular technology is more than ever before calling for a deeper collaboration amongst technologists, researchers, bio-molecular device experts, IC designers, and system level designers.

            <p class="text-justify">
              The Institution of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers (IETE) founded in 1953 is one of the leading Professional Society in India. With the great vision of founder and subsequent forefathers and stalwarts who were leading light of the Institution IETE, have been devoting and contributing for the advancement of Science and Technology in the fields of Electronics, Communication Engineering, Computer Science, Information Technology and other related subjects. The major focus of IETE is to provide engineering education i.e. Degree and Diploma level certifications to younger generation at affordable cost who can not afford it through regular & private engineering institutions at exorbitant cost. IETE has got two streams of Student base. First wing is the students of alma-mater , IETE , viz, the pass outs of DIPIETE , AMIETE and ALCCS students . For them we have an Alumni Association formed in 2013 and the Second one is the Engineering students studying in Engineering Colleges and Polytechnics across the Country. This wing is the ISF ( IETE Students Forum ). More than 550 live ISFs are functioning in India today with a student membership of more than 60,000.
